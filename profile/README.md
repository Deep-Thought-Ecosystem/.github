# 📖 Deep Thought Docs  

Welcome to the **documentation hub** of the **Deep Thought Ecosystem** —  
*an ecosystem of independent projects: the answer to building applications, the universe, and everything.*  

This project is a personal attempt to build a complete web API–based solution featuring authentication and authorization using JWT, support for multiple user interfaces, and integration of various technologies.

It follows modern development patterns such as Dependency Injection (DI) and CI/CD pipelines, serving both as a showcase and a learning experience.

You are welcome to use this code as inspiration or as a starting point for your own project, especially if you are at the beginning of your career, to better understand how these practices are essential for professional software development.
